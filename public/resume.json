Features included search views with cross-table filters and sorting, summary views, CRUD operations, CRONs operations and asynchronous data synchronization.\n - Connection to external APIs for data enrichment\n - Setup of test harness on the backend (end-to-end and unit tests)\n - Process improvement in order to provide more visibility and clarity to tasks",

We underwent a lot of back and forth on the product with our prospects, and after first confirmations of interest, we settled on a verification and comparison engine for tender bids. This engine would ensure:\n - All bids respond to the construction work specification fully. Missing items are identified\n - Prices can be compared between identical items.\n\nA few of the challenges I had to overcome:\n - Table parsing from excel / pdf, including columns identification\n - Matching between identical items between tender bids to enable comparison\n - AI model deployments that would help in the matching (OCR, custom AI)\n - Reliable prompts (especially making them reliable and maintain them when OpenAI updated its models)",
