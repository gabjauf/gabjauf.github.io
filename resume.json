    "summary": "Engineer by training, I undertook 7 years ago now a career change to go towards what is now my passion, IT.  With a training at EPITA having given me deep knowledge both in low-level languages (C and C++, Go) and those used in the web (Javascript, Typescript, Python), I turned to web development at the end of my course in order to design ergonomic and efficient cloud applications.  After 4 years at Bloomflow, a startup that aims to revolutionize and industrialize creative innovation processes, having learned a lot about the mechanisms of disruptive innovation within a caring and talented team, I decided to embark on the entrepreneurial adventure by co-founding Toha, the application that influences future second-hand trends.",

We underwent a lot of back and forth on the product with our prospects, and after first confirmations of interest, we settled on a verification and comparison engine for tender bids in the construction industry. This engine would ensure: - All bids respond to the construction work specification fully. Missing items are identified - Prices can be compared between identical items  A few of the challenges I had to overcome: - Table parsing from excel / pdf, including columns identification - Matching between identical items between tender bids to enable comparison - AI model deployments that would help in the matching (OCR, custom AI) - Reliable prompts (especially making them reliable and maintain them when OpenAI updated its models)",
